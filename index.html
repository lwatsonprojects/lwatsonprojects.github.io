        <p>Cr&#234pes can be eaten with any toppings you can think of. While sweet  toppings like fruit, chocolate, whipped cream, and caramel are what usually come to mind, savoury cr&#234pes with cheese, meat, or saut&#233ed veggies make a quick, delicious meal. You should have your toppings already prepared before starting, or take a break at step 4 to prepare them before proceeding with the cooking steps.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, whisk eggs until frothy.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add milk, oil, and salt and whisk well.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add flour slowly while whisking to avoid lumps.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Allow to sit for a few minutes to let foam dissipate.
</p>
<p>You will need to work quickly from this point on - cr&#234pes cook <em>very</em> quickly. You should have a plate ready to store the cr&#234pes until you are ready to eat them.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Melt a small amount of butter or add a small amount of oil or cooking spray to a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once pan is hot, add one ladle of batter, angling the pan to ensure full coverage. Only add enough batter to just barely cover the bottom of the pan. 
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> When edges start to brown, flip the cr&#234pe, if desired. Cook the second side for only  45-60 seconds, then remove from the heat. If you are making a large batch, you may choose to keep the cooked cr&#234pes warm by placing them an a heat-proof plate in a cold oven with the oven light on.
</p>
<p>Serve with toppings of your choice and enjoy!</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 400&#186F. Grease or line 12 muffin cups.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Combine flour, sugar,baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
</p>    
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix lemon juice and milk together to sour milk, then beat together with eggs, oil, and lemon zest in a small bowl.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just moistened - do not over-mix.
</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Fold in cranberries gently. Again, do not over-mix.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Fill prepared muffin cups about 2/3 full, then sprinkle with toppings (if desired).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, about 18-20 minutes.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Cool for 5 minutes in the pan before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
</p>
<p>Experiment with different toppings and add-ins. You can substitute the cranberries with blueberries, raspberries, chopped pear, or other fruit of your choice. Or omit them completely and enjoy the summery lemon flavour (or lime, by easily substituting the lemon juice and zest with lime juice and zest). Top with nuts, seeds, fruit, granola, or crushed cookies. These easy-peasy muffins make a beautiful backdrop to whatever flavours you wish to add.

        <p>This tiramisu recipe results in a finished dish with uncooked egg. If you are concerned about the freshness or quality of your eggs, or if you are serving to very young or susceptible people, please consider using pasteurized egg replacements instead.
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Separate the eggs, placing the yolks in a large bowl and the whites in a smaller bowl.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add 70 g of the sugar to the egg yolks and whip until creamy. Add the mascarpone to the egg yolks a little at a time and incorporate fully before adding more. Set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> With <strong>clean</strong> beaters (this is critical, otherwise your whites won't whip properly), whip the egg whites and slowly add 70 g of the sugar, ensuring it is fully incorporated. Continue whipping the egg whites until they form <strong>firm peaks</strong>.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Gently fold the whites into the yolks, a little at a time, making sure they are well incorporated before adding more. Chill the mixture while assembling the remaining ingredients. You may choose to place the mixture in a piping bag to simplify the upcoming assembly stage.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a shallow dish that will allow you to dip the Savoiardi flat, mix the coffee, liqueur, and remaining 10 g of the sugar. Mix well.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> In a 9" x 9" (23 cm x 23 cm) baking dish, place a small amount of the egg mixture in an even layer - just enough to hold the cookies in place.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Dip the bottoms (unsugared side) of the Savoiardi one at a time in the coffee mixture and place <strong>sugar side up</strong> in the baking pan in a single layer. Be careful not to dip the cookies for too long - they absorb the coffee and become mushy quickly.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> When the layer of Savoiardi is complete, cover with a layer of egg mixture and top with a dusting of cacao. Place the next layer of cookies perpendicular to the layer below. Alternate layers of egg mixture and cookies, topping each layer of egg mixture with cacao. Final layer should be egg mixture. Top with cacao garnish.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Chill, preferably overnight, but even a couple of hours help the flavours to mature and the egg mixture to set up. Enjoy!</p>
        <p><strong>Variations:</strong>
</p>
        <ul>
            <li>mixed berry or blueberry-banana pur&#233e - thin with water for dipping cookies and use thicker pur&#233e in place of cacao between layers and on top, or top with decoratively cut fruit. Use a flavoured vodka or sangria in place of coffee liqueur (if used).</li>
            <li>citrus - grapefruit-orange or coconut-lime for bright, summery flavours. You need more of the citrus juice than you think in order for the flavour to really come through. Adding zest helps too. Flavoured vodka or tequila can be used in place of coffee liqueur (if used)</li>
            <li>apple cinnamon caramel - dip cookies in apple cider or apple juice and use applesauce, caramel drizzle, and a sprinkle of cinnamon to top each layer of egg mixture. For the liqueur, try butter rippple schnapps or apple vodka.</li>
            <li>chocolate - any kind of chocolate you like. Dark, milk, white, or flavoured chocolate can be used. Be sure to pair it with a complementary liqueur, if used. Top with chocolate curls for a classy look.</li>
            <li>these are just the variations that have worked for me. The base recipe is very versatile and the flavour combinations are limited only by your imagination.</li>
        </ul>
